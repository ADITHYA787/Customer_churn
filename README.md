# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Prediction System

A robust, end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn using behavioral and demographic data. Built using XGBoost and Python, the model enables businesses to proactively identify at-risk users and take retention actions.

Features

- **Supervised ML Classification**: Uses XGBoost for high-performance binary classification.
- **Feature Engineering**: Encodes categorical and numerical data with preprocessing pipelines.
- **Churn Probability Scoring**: Returns likelihood of churn along with class label.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Provides insights into top features influencing churn.
- **Train-Test Evaluation**: Includes precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve evaluation.
- **Model Serialization**: Saves trained model using `joblib` for deployment or inference use.
- **Modular Codebase**: Clean structure for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and inference steps.
- **Optional Flask/FastAPI Ready**: Model can be integrated into API services for real-time usage.

Architecture

Components

- **Data Processing**: Cleans input, handles missing values, and encodes features.
- **Model Training**: Builds and evaluates the churn classifier.
- **Evaluation Module**: Reports key metrics and plots ROC/AUC curves.
- **Feature Importance**: Visualizes which features drive churn the most.
- **Model Export**: Stores trained `.pkl` file for inference.
